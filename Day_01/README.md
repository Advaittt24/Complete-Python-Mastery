# Python Keywords and Identifiers

Python, keywords are reserved words that have predefined meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.). They are used to define the syntax and structure of the language. Here is a list of Python keywords:

|-|-|-|-|-|
|------|------|--------|------|-----|
|False      |class|      finally    |is  |       return|
|None       |continue|   for       | lambda|     try|
|True      | def      |  from     |  nonlocal|   while|
|and      |  del       | global  |   not      |  with|
|as      |   elif       |if     |    or        | yield|
|assert |    else       |import|     pass|
|break |     except     |in  |       raise|

Identifiers, on the other hand, are names used to identify variables, functions, classes, modules, or other objects in Python. They are user-defined and should follow certain rules:

- An identifier must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_) character.
- The remaining characters in an identifier can be letters, underscores, or digits (0-9).
- Identifiers are case-sensitive, meaning "myVar" and "myvar" are considered different identifiers.
- Python keywords cannot be used as identifiers.

Here are some examples of valid identifiers:

```python
my_variable
counter
PI
calculate_sum
_name
```

And here are some examples of invalid identifiers:

```python
1variable  # Starts with a digit
my-variable  # Contains a hyphen
class  # Reserved keyword
```

It's important to choose meaningful and descriptive names for your identifiers to enhance code readability and maintainability.
